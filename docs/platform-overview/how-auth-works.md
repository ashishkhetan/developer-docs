# Overview

In this page we cover how as a developer, you can implement the Beyond Identity solution to authenticate your application's users by placing trust on the devices they control. 

## How to establish Device Trust


## How do we create Passkeys


## How do users authenticate with Passkeys


## What does the user need to know about Passkeys


## How does this integrate with my existing systems

- Treat BI as an IDP. Here are the protocols we support. 
- Graphic showing the delegation process at a high level. 

## Does this use WebAuthn? 

- We do when it makes sense. In other cases we public private keys, with other mechanisms that are not WebAuthn.
